Installation
============

To install the tool, it is recommended that you use the `latest official PyPI release <https://pypi.org/project/gocd-tools>`_ ::

    pip install gocd-tools

Alternatively, you can also install the tool by directly cloning and installing the current repo HEAD.
However this is not recommended, since it is not guranteed that this is stable edition that will be fetched::

    git clone git@github.com:rasmunk/gocd-tools.git
    cd gocd-tools
    pip3 install .

After either of these installation approaces has been applied, you should now be ready to configure the `gocd-tools`.
