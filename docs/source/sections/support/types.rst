Supported Types
===============

.. _target supported types:

Which types the tool support, is defined by how many of the objects and operations in the `GoCD API <https://api.gocd.org/current/#introduction>`_ I have gotten around to implement. Currently, the tools supports configuring the following types.

    * `Artifacts Config <https://api.gocd.org/current/#artifacts-config>`__
    * `Cluster Profiles <https://api.gocd.org/current/#cluster-profiles>`_
    * `Config Repo <https://api.gocd.org/current/#config-repo>`_
    * `Elastic Agent Profiles <https://api.gocd.org/current/#elastic-agent-profiles>`_
    * `Pipeline Group Config <https://api.gocd.org/current/#pipeline-group-config>`_
    * `Roles <https://api.gocd.org/current/#roles>`_
    * `Secret Configs <https://api.gocd.org/current/#secret-configs>`_
    * `Template Config <https://api.gocd.org/current/#template-config>`_
