Welcome to gocd-tools's!
========================

Gocd-tools is a tool for automating several management tasks for the `GoCD <https://www.gocd.org>`_ server.
This includes the configuration and cleanup of server configurations, including `Pipelines <https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/pipelines.html>`_, `Config Repositories <https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/config_repo.html>`_, `Templates <https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/pipeline_templates.html>`_, and beyond.
The total list of currently supported server configuration management can be seen in :ref:`Supported Types <target supported types>`.
